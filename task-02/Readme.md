# Terminal Chaos

1. After finding the medallion.py file in the entrance 3 i used cat to read it contents
which told me to go to parchment.txt. 
2. In the parchment.txt i got the code aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRo and next step is to change 
branch.
3. Now im going to light realm by using git checkout.
4. After reaching here im using grep 'good' 'holy' * in terminal to find files containing
the given words.
5. I came to find out that if i use grep -l it can list the documents or txts which contain the
keywords if i didnt use -l it would show the whole text file writings which is a lot.



GOOD - Enerflare.txt   Henbane.txt   Harmonix.txt   Sylvanvine.txt  Hemlock.txt  Lavender.txt    JimsonWeed.txt                   
HOLY-  Aetherleaf.txt  Dreambloom.txt   Revivara.txt   Nightshad.txt   Dragon'sBreath.txt   Dreambloom.txt            


BOTH:
Moonbloom.txt
Mistveil.txt

6. Light Book Code = dWIuY29tL2FtYW5ze   (dont know what its for now)
7. Also this was in the key Press 'p' when he is 1 sec away from hitting you to land a succesful parry.
Oh i had to go back to light realm and run the python and use the above information

I parried him 3 times but i think i got the code wrong
OK after getting the right code i switched back to the dark realm usiong the git checkout

8. After going iunto entrance 3 i found chest 1 and used the mulet after running python to get the darkbook 1

```
9. After switihcing brach to dark 2 i found the chest and again used amulet code to get the darkbook 2

10. After going into the website https://github.com/amansxcalibur/Terminal-Chaos-GodSuite i cloned it in to my terminal and now used
git log to see all the commits. I didnt know how to read what commit they did so searched in google where i saw
git show <the code of the commit> which gave me the different chapters of the story.
Now as i surf throught the chapters of the boys story about gaining knowledge from all realms

11. In the chambers east of the Eolian caves in the 9th path leading to the 4th chamber( i think its a clue)

```
12. I found this code in the same paragraph and when i decoded it i got  https://github.com/angrezichatterbox/To-the-stars-and-realms-unseen
this website.

13. This script must be run with the '--run' argument from the command line.
i got this problem while trying to run the victory file.
